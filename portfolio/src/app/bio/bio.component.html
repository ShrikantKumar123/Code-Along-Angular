        <h2>SHRIKANT KUMAR</h2>
        <p>I am a passinate Engineer with a degree in Computer Science & Engineering.
            My very first experience with code wasat the time when I started my own blog.
            My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS. Sooner,
            the excitment of having th power to structure
            pages on my own sounded amazing and that's when I decided to purse Web devlopment.

            Recently, I have taken up a Full Stack Development program with FACE. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and
            javascript, Java, python and Data Structures.
            Rational thought process and goal-oriented
            planning are my strengths.
            <span class="break"></span>

            I am currently on the look out for a challenging role
            to build products that make a difference.
